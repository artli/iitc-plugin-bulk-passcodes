This [IITC](https://iitc.me/) plugin enables bulk passcode submission: if several passcodes are entered simultaneously, it submits them consecutively with random delays.

[Install plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/artli/iitc-plugin-bulk-passcodes/latestRelease/bulk-passcodes.user.js) (Tampermonkey is required, as well as [the main IITC userscript](https://static.iitc.me/build/release/total-conversion-build.user.js)).
